# General
This is a repo used to record my thoughts during the study of uvm source code.

The latest uvm ieee 1800.2-2020.1.1 doesn't have the reference Manual itself. 
So I download the uvm 1.2 RM from Accellera and upload it here. 
Use it as a map or a handbook to explore uvm source code. 
Basically, this RM is generaged automatically from the comments of uvm source code.

# Reference
* Here is a good reference-UVM_COOKBOOK from SIEMENS. https://verificationacademy.com/cookbook
* There are lots of good papers about SV and UVM. http://www.sunburst-design.com/
